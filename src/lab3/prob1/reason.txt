Q1.

P1 is an instance of PersonWithJob and P2 is an
instance of Person.

In the first comparison P1 is being compared with P2,
here the equals method in PersonWithJob checks if the
object being compared is an instance of PersonWithJob
or not.
Since the second object is an Instance of Person but not
an Instance of PersonWithJob so it gives false results.

While in the second comparison similar to the equals
method of PersonWithJob, equals method of Person class
is comparing if the object being compared is an instance
of the Person class or not. Since any object that is an
instance of the PersonWithJob is also an instance of
Person class as PersonWithJob is inherited from Person
class it gives us a true result.
